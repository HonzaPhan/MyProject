<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Long Phan. I was born and raised in the Czech Republic, even though my ethnicity is Vietnamese, my soul and body have 2 cultures and I am so grateful for it. I chose a path to become a Data Analyst, thats why this project will include programming languages and visualization tools like MySQL/MariaDB(We used MariaDB in Engeto course), Python, PowerBI or even Tableau. We will see. Wish me luck guys!

In my project I will be focusing on various data sets, which I find on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets"> Kaggle.com</a>.</p>

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>For my very first own project I chose data set <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahuldabholkar/steam-pc-games">PC Games on Steam platform</a>, because I am a huge fan of game industry and I find this dataset is going to be my cup of tea.
