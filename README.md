<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Long Phan. I was born and raised in the Czech Republic, even though my ethnicity is Vietnamese, my soul and body have 2 cultures and I am so grateful for it. I chose a path to become a Data Analyst, thats why this project will include programming languages and visualization tools like MySQL/MariaDB(We used MariaDB in Engeto course), Python, PowerBI or even Tableau.
<br>
We will see. Wish me luck guys!
<br>
<br>
In my project I will be focusing on various data sets, which I find on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets"> Kaggle.com</a>.</p>
